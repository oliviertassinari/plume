!========================================================
!  Define the text descriptors. 
!========================================================
!     We have one for each direction of the off- or onto- page connector cell it's 
!     to be attached to.
!          *UP is for connectors that point up.
!          *DOWN is for connectors that point down.
!          *RIGHT is for connectors that point right.
!          *LEFT is for connectors that point left.
!
!     The format of each text descriptor is:
!*<direction> just=<paragraph just>,<line just> [ROTATE] "<1st control string>" ["<2nd control string>" ["<3rd control string>"]]
!
!     Note:There are no carriage returns in the text descriptor format above.
!          Each text descriptor must appear on a single line. The appearance
!          of multiple lines in the format above is due to editor line wrapping.
!          The arguments enclosed in [] indicate optional arguments.
!
!     Each text descriptor defines:
!
!       1) Text justification - consists of paragraph justification and line justification 
!          separated by a comma. Valid values for Paragraph justification are TOP, MIDDLE and BOTTOM. 
!          Valid values for Line justifications are LEFT, CENTER and RIGHT.
!
!       2) Text Rotation - optional setting that controls whether the annotated text aligns with 
!          rotated connector cells (optional). The ROTATE option is only meaningful when annotating
!          connectors pointing in the *UP and *DOWN directions.
!
! 		NOTE: If there is already text of the type defined by *TEXTTYPE above
!          	      on the connector, that text will be used as a template and
!          	      the justification and rotation defined here will be ignored. 
!                 To force the use of this information, use the "Reset/Update text 
!                 attributes, rotation and justification" option (-delete command line)
!                 which will delete the text before starting to annotate.
!
!  	  3) The 'control' strings.  There can be up to three strings enclosed 
!          in double quotes and they define the contents and layout of the string 
!          to be added to cells going in each direction.
!
!========================================================
!  CONTROL STRINGS
!========================================================
!	The strings are:
!
!  *************************************************
!   The first control string. 
!  *************************************************
!	The first control string is a prefix string and is processed once 
!	when annotating a connector. Any connector specific information 
!	refers to the connector being annotated. The first control string  
!	may contain any character except '"' but special sequence characters are:
!          
!	\r - carriage return
!
!	%s - insert a list of sheet numbers where this net occurs. If this 
!          is the source connector, the number of sheets included comes from the
!          *SOURCE list descriptor below. If this is the target 
!          connector, the number of sheets included comes from the *TARGET 
!          list descriptor below.  %s should only be used when you 
!          only have one control string and are only cross referencing a single schematic.
!
!	%k - insert the unique net key (mnemonic) here.
!
!	%f - insert the flat netname (%f is only meaningful when using the 
!          Annotate the entire design (-hier command line) option).
!
!     The following special sequence characters can be used in this control string
!     but be aware that they refer to the connector being annotated. (Note: this
!     means that the information is referring to the location and position of the
!     connector being annotated and not connectors on the other pages that are 
!     connected to this same signal.)              
!
!	%d - insert the hierarchical page number (for hierarchical designs %d is only 
!          meaningful when using the Annotate the entire design (-hier command line) 
!	     option, but for flat designs (meaninig single block designs) %p and %d 
!	     give the same results).
!
!	%b - insert the block instance path. This is the path to the connector 
!          being annotated.
!
!	%p - insert a single page number here.  For first control string, this is the
!          page number within the file where the connector being annotated is 
!          located when using the Annotate the entire design (-hier command line) option, 
!          you probably want to use %b as well as %p.
!
!	%n - insert the local netname. This is the name of the net connected 
!          to the connector being annotated.  
!
!	%x - insert the X coordinate of the connector being annotated.
!
!	%y - insert the Y coordinate of the connector being annotated.
!
!	%h - insert the horizontal zone label of the connector being annotated.
!
!	%v - insert the vertical zone label of the connector being annotated.
!
!  *************************************************
!   The second control string.
!  *************************************************
!	Second string is processed once for each connection except as limited
!	by the *SOURCE and *TARGET lines (see below). The second 
!	control string may contain any character except '"' but special
!	sequence characters are:
!          
!	\r - carriage return
!
!	%d - insert the hierarchical page number (for hierarchical designs %d is only 
!          meaningful when using the Annotate the entire design (-hier command line) 
!	     option, but for flat designs (meaninig single block designs) %p and %d 
!	     give the same results).
!
!	%b - insert the block instance path. For the middle control string,
!          this is the block instance path to the other connection.
!
!	%p - insert a single page number here. For the middle control 
!          string this is the page number with the block where the 
!          Connection being referenced is located.  When using
!          the Annotate the entire design (-hier command line) option,
!          you probably want to use %b as well as %p.
!
!	%n - insert the local netname. For the middle control string
!          this is the netname of the connection being referenced.
!               
!	%x - insert the X coordinate of the connection being referenced.
!
!	%y - insert the Y coordinate of the connection being referenced.
!
!	%h - insert the horizontal zone label connection being referenced.
!
!	%v - insert the vertical zone label connection being referenced.
!
!  *************************************************
!   The third control string.  
!  *************************************************
!	The third control string is a postfix string and is processed 
!	once at the end of the connector being annotated. The third control 
!	string may contain any character except '"' but special sequence 
!	characters are:
!          
!	\r - carriage return
!
!	%s - insert a list of sheet numbers where this net occurs. If this 
!          is the source connector, the number of sheets included comes from the
!          *SOURCE list descriptor below. If this is the target connector,
!          the number of sheets included comes from the *TARGET 
!          list descriptor below.  %s should only be used when you 
!          only have one control string and are only cross referencing
!          a single schematic.
!
!	%k - insert the unique net key (mnemonic) here.
!
!	%f - insert the flat netname (%f is only meaningful when using the 
!          Annotate the entire design (-hier command line) option.
!
!	The following special sequence characters can be used in this control string
!	but be aware that they refer to the connector being annotated. (Note: this
!	means that the information is referring to the location and position of the
!	connector being annotated and not connectors on the other pages that are 
!	connected to this same signal.)              
!
!	%d - insert the hierarchical page number (for hierarchical designs %d is only 
!          meaningful when using the Annotate the entire design (-hier command line) 
!	     option, but for flat designs (meaninig single block designs) %p and %d 
!	     give the same results).
!
!	%b - insert the block instance path. This is the path to the connector 
!          being annotated.
!
!	%p - insert a single page number here.  For the third control string, this is 
!          the page number within the file where the connector being annotated
!          is located. When using the Annotate the entire design (-hier command line) 
!          option, you probably want to use %b as well as %p.
!
!	%n - insert the local netname. This is the name of the net connected 
!          to the connector being annotated.  
!
!	%x - insert the X coordinate of the connector being annotated.

!	%y - insert the Y coordinate of the connector being annotated.
!
!	%h - insert the horizontal zone label of the connector being annotated.
!
!	%v - insert the vertical zone label of the connector being annotated.
!
!========================================================
! Default text descriptors
!========================================================
! The default text descriptors are very basic and designed for use with flat 
! designs.  Note, they use all three control string, but the first and third 
! control strings are empty.  The second control string will get processed
! for each connection.  To make more extensive use of the control strings 
! refer to the examples above and then create your own custom text descriptors
! in the section below. If you want to use a custom set of descriptors, make
! sure to comment out the default text descriptors. (See Examples Section below.)
!
!*LEFT just=TOP,LEFT "" "sht %p %n" ""
!*RIGHT just=TOP,RIGHT "" "%n sht %p" ""
!*UP just=TOP,LEFT ROTATE "" "sht %p %n" ""
!*DOWN just=BOTTOM,LEFT ROTATE "" "%n sht %p" ""
!
!========================================================
! Custom text descriptors
!========================================================
! Create your custom text descriptors here for the LEFT, RIGHT, UP and DOWN
! connectors.  Add control string information as desired making sure to consider 
! the type of design style (flat vs. hierarchical). 
!
! Here are two sets of text descriptors that you might consider using.  One set 
! is for use with hierarchical designs and the other is for use with flat designs.
! Both sets are based on the examples given below.  To use one of these sets of 
! text descriptors or one of your customized sets, you will need to comment the 
! default set of text descriptors above and uncomment one set of descriptors below.
!
!
!
! This set of descriptors includes the hierarchical page number before the sheet number in the current schematic.  
!
! Hierarchical design text descriptors with hierarchical page number
! ------------------------------------------------------------------
!
! This set of descriptors is based on Example 1 below and places the text at the end of the cell. 
!*LEFT just=MIDDLE, RIGHT "Flat Net is %f and connections are:" "\rPage:%d-%b(sheet:%p)" "\rCurrent connector being annotated is: Page:%d-%b(sheet:%p)"
!*RIGHT just=MIDDLE, LEFT "Flat Net is %f and connections are:" "\rPage:%d-%b(sheet:%p)" "\rCurrent connector being annotated is: Page:%d-%b(sheet:%p)"
!*UP just=BOTTOM,CENTER ROTATE "Flat Net is %f and connections are:" "\rPage:%d-%b(sheet:%p)" "\rCurrent connector being annotated is: Page:%d-%b(sheet:%p)"
!*DOWN just=TOP,CENTER ROTATE "Flat Net is %f and connections are:" "\rPage:%d-%b(sheet:%p)" "\rCurrent connector being annotated is: Page:%d-%b(sheet:%p)"
!
!
!
! Flat design text descriptors
! ----------------------------
!
! This set of descriptors is pulled from Example 14. 
!*LEFT just=MIDDLE, RIGHT "%p:%n " "%p:%n %h%v at <%x,%y>" "."
!*RIGHT just=MIDDLE, LEFT "%p:%n " "%p:%n %h%v at <%x,%y>" "."
!*UP just=BOTTOM,CENTER ROTATE "%p:%n " "%p:%n %h%v at <%x,%y>" "."
!*DOWN just=TOP,CENTER ROTATE "%p:%n " "%p:%n %h%v at <%x,%y>" "."
!
! 
!========================================================
!  Examples
!========================================================
!
! Two sets of examples follow, one set for use when annotating hierarchical designs and 
! another set for use when annotating flat designs.
!
!
! --------------------------------------------------
!  Hierarchical Design Examples (EX's 1-7)
! --------------------------------------------------
!
! Examples for use when using the Annotate the entire design (-hier command line) option.
! (Hierarchical designs).  All examples are for a design with the following characteristics:
! - Two blocks (topblock and bottomblock)
! - topblock has one page and bottomblock has 2 pages
! - We are annotating a connector on page 1 of topblock connected to NETA
! - NETA is connected to pin A on the bottomblock1 instance of bottomblock
! - bottomblock page 1 contains a hierarchical connector named A that is connected to
!   a net named localnet
! - localnet is also connected to an interpage connector on page 2 of bottomblock
!
! Unless specified, all examples are using a LEFT pointing connector with the 
! annotation to the right of the connector and aligned with the middle of the connector.
!
!
! Example 1
! -----------
! The following example shows that the third control string is optional.  This example
! will provide a list of connections and no information about the connector being annotated.
! In this example, the text is to the left of the connector.
! The text descriptor:
!*LEFT just=MIDDLE, LEFT "" "%b sht %p" 
!
! ... results in the following annotation:
!
! topblock!bottomblock1 sht 1,topblock!bottomblock1 sht 1,topblock!bottomblock1 sht 2
!
!
! Example 2
! -----------
! The following example shows that the third control string is optional.  This example
! will provide a list of connections and no information about the connector being annotated.
! In this example, the text is to the left of the connector.
! The text descriptor:
!*LEFT just=MIDDLE, LEFT "" "%d" 
!
! ... results in the following annotation:
!
! 2,2,3
!
!
! Example 3
! -----------
! The following example again shows that the third control string is optional.  This example
! will provide a list of connections including the local netname and no information about
! the connector being annotated.  In this example, the connector is pointing up and the 
! annotation will be to the left of the connector and will be aligned with the top of the 
! connector.  Also, the text will be rotated with the connector (ROTATE option is used).
! The text descriptor:
!*UP just=TOP, LEFT ROTATE "" "sht %p %n %b" 
!
! ... results in the following annotation:
! 
! sht 1 localnet topblock!bottomblock1,sht 1 localnet topblock!bottomblock1,sht 2 localnet topblock!bottomblock1
!
!
! Example 4
! -----------
! The following example again shows that the third control string is optional.  This example
! will provide a list of connections including the local netname and no information about
! the connector being annotated.  In this example, the connector is pointing up and the 
! annotation will be to the left of the connector and will be aligned with the top of the 
! connector.  Also, the text will be rotated with the connector (ROTATE option is used).
! The text descriptor:
!*UP just=TOP, LEFT ROTATE "" "sht %d %n" 
!
! ... results in the following annotation:
!
!sht 2 localnet,sht 2 localnet,sht 3 localnet
!
!
! Example 5
! -----------
! The following example will display the block, sheet and zone information for each connector.
! It includes no information about the current connector.
! In this example, the annotation will be aligned with the top of the connector:
! The text descriptor:
!*LEFT just=TOP, RIGHT "" "%b-SH:%p-%v%h" 
!
! ... results in the following annotation:
!
! topblock!bottomblock1-SH:1-d7,topblock!bottomblock1-SH:1-d2,topblock!bottomblock1-SH:2-d7
!
!
! Example 6
! -----------
! The following example shows how location information can be included in the annotation.
! This will display the block, page and flat netname of the connector being annotated
! and the block, page, local netname and location information for each connection.
! The text descriptor:
!*LEFT just=MIDDLE, RIGHT "%b(%p):%f " "%b(%p):%n %h%v at <%x,%y>" "."
!
! ... results in the following annotation:
!
! topblock(1):NETA topblock!bottomblock1(1):localnet 7d at <-5450,3800>,topblock!bottomblock1(1):localnet 2d at <4600,4300>,topblock!bottomblock1(2):localnet 7d at <-5200,4050>.
!
!
! Example 7
! -----------
! The following example will print the flat netname and a list of connections 
! followed by information about the connector being annotated and shows the hierarchical sheet number. 
! The text descriptor:
!*LEFT just=MIDDLE, RIGHT "Flat Net is %f and connections are:" "\rPage:%d-%b(sheet:%p)" "\rCurrent connector being annotated is: Page:%d-%b(sheet:%p)"
!
! ... results in the following annotation:
!
!
! Flat Net is NETA and connections are:
! Page:2-topblock!bottomblock1(sheet:1),
! Page:2-topblock!bottomblock1(sheet:1),
! Page:3-topblock!bottomblock1(sheet:2)
! Current connector being annotated is: Page:1-topblock(sheet:1)
!
!
! ---------------------------------------
!  Flat Design Examples  (Ex's 8-14)
! ---------------------------------------
!
! Examples for use when NOT using the Annotate the entire design (-hier command line)
! option. That is FLAT designs or when annotating each file in a hierarchical design separately
! (just interpage connector and not hierarchical connector cross referencing).  The examples
! use the same design as above, but a third page has been added to bottomblock with a connector
! connected to localnet.  And in these examples, we are only annotating bottomblock and the 
! annotations listed are for the inter page connector:
!
!
! Example 8
! -----------
! The following example will  just list the pages of the connections. 
! The text descriptor:
!*LEFT just=MIDDLE, RIGHT "SH " " %p" 
!
! ... results in the following annotation:
!
! SH 1, 2 ,3
!
!
! Example 9
! -----------
! The following example includes the page number and the local netname.  
! In this example, the connector is pointing up and the 
! annotation will be to the left of the connector and will be aligned with the top of the 
! connector.  Also, the text will be rotated with the connector (ROTATE option is used).
! The text descriptor:
!*UP just=TOP, LEFT ROTATE "" "sht %p %n" 
!
! ... results in the following annotation:
!
! sht 1 localnet,sht 2 localnet,sht 3 localnet
!
!
! Example 10a
! -----------
! The following example will shows the use of %s in the first control string.  This will include
! a complete list of pages for the file that is being annotated. Note, the annotation will be to 
! the left of the connector. 
! The text descriptor:
!*LEFT just=MIDDLE, LEFT "%n sht %s" "" 
!
! ... results in the following annotation:
!
! localnet sht 1,2,3
!
! Example 10b
! -----------
! As an example of what NOT to do, what would have been the result if the first and
! second control strings were swapped ("" "%n sht %s")?  It would have been:
! The text descriptor:
!*LEFT just=MIDDLE, LEFT "" "%n sht %s" 
!
! ... results in the following annotation:
!
! localnet sht 1,2,3,localnet sht 1,2,3,localnet sht 1,2,3
!
! Remember that the second control string is repeated once for each connection and
! %s always includes all pages.
!

! Example 11
! -----------
! The following example displays a list of sheets and the local netname.  In these
! examples, the annotation is different depending on the rotation of the connector.
! These are examples of the control strings that will be used by default (shown below).
! The text descriptors:
!*LEFT just=MIDDLE,RIGHT "sht %s %n"  
!*RIGHT just=MIDDLE,LEFT "%n sht %s"
!*UP just=BOTTOM,CENTER ROTATE "sht %s %n"
!*DOWN just=TOP,CENTER ROTATE     "%n sht %s"
!
! ... result in the following annotation:
!
! For *LEFT:
! sht 1,2,3 localnet
! For *RIGHT, the annotation will be to the left of the connector:
! localnet sht 1,2,3
! For *UP, the annotation will be aligned with the center of the connector and will be below
! the connector:
! sht 1,2,3 localnet
! For *DOWN, the annotation will be aligned with the center of the connector and will be above
! the connector:
! localnet sht 1,2,3
!
! Example 12
! -----------
! The following line does the same thing as *RIGHT in the previous section
! This just shows how the same thing can be specified with two control strings and
! using %p.
! The text descriptor:
!*RIGHT just=MIDDLE, LEFT "%n sht " "%p"
!
! ... results in the following annotation:
!
! localnet sht 1,2,3

!
! Example 13
! -----------
! The following example will print the local netname and a list of connections 
! followed by information about the connector being annotated.
! The text descriptor:
!*LEFT just=MIDDLE, RIGHT "Net is %n and connections are:" "\rsheet:%p" "\rCurrent connector being annotated is: sheet:%p"          
!
! ... results in the following annotation:
!
! Net is localnet and connections are:
! sheet:1,
! sheet:2,
! sheet:3
! Current connector being annotated is: sheet:1
!
!
! Example 14
! -----------
! The following example shows how location information can be included in the annotation.
! This will display the page and local netname of the connector being annotated
! and the page, local netname and location information for each connection.
! The text descriptor:
!*LEFT just=MIDDLE, RIGHT "%p:%n " "%p:%n %h%v at <%x,%y>" "."
!
! ... results in the following annotation:
!
! 1:localnet 1:localnet 2d at <4600,4300>,2:localnet 7d at <-5200,4050>,3:localnet 6d at <-3400,2750>.
!
! 
!========================================================
! List descriptors
!========================================================
!..   Define the list descriptors. There are two of these, SOURCE and TARGET. They  
!     define what goes in the '%s' section of the control strings above, as well 
!     as how many times the second control string is processed. The SOURCE list is 
!     used for the 'source' of a particular net, and the TARGET list is used for 
!     all other occurrences.
!
!     When processing a single block, the source is the connector
!     with an input pin (normally an Output Connector), since this
!     is where the net leaves that page and goes to all the other pages.
!
!     IMPORTANT NOTE:
!     When using the "Annotate the entire design" (-hier command line) option the source 
!     is the connector connected to the top most occurrence of the net in the hierarchy.
!
!     Each list descriptor contains a 'list=' directive, which defines the 
!     maximum number of sheets to be listed. It's value may be any number
!     or 'NONE' or 'ALL'.  'ALL' indicates all connections not including the connector
!     being annotated.
!
!     If the list value is 'ALL' or greater than 1, there must also be
!     a separator directive. The separator is used to separate the

!..   Define whether connectors should be annotated with
!     information from all other types of connectors or only with
!     information from the same type of connection.  A value of 'ALL'
!     indicates that all connectors are annotated with information from
!     all other types.  A value of 'LIKE' means that connectors are
!     only annotated with information from connectors of like types.

!..   Define the string to be used as a separator between annotations
!     on the same symbol that apply to different instances of the block.

!..   Define whether intrapage connectors should be annotated with
!     information from other pages or not.  A value of 'SAME' indicates
!     that annotations on intrapage connectors should only include
!     connectors on the same page.  A value of 'ALL' indicates that
!     intrapage connectors are not treated differently from other connectors
!     and will include information from connectors on all pages/levels.
!     Default is to include other pages to be consistant with past
